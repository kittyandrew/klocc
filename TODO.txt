* WIP  -- Adding more stats of different kind. References - https://github.com/src-d/hercules, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828874/generating-statistics-from-git-repository

* IDEA -- Since we are probably going to download everything (full depth), repositories like torvalds/linux are extremely heavy and might require a lot of time. We might want to limit updating (replacing cached data) for repositories that are bigger than certain size on disk to much bigger time (i.e. write a table of size-time relation, like 0-10MB - 5 min, 10-100MB - 30 min, 100-1000MB - 6 hours, >1000MB - 24 hours). At that point might be worth to allow configuring these as env vars.
